Additionally, your growing uterus puts pressure on your bladder, giving it less room  to store urine.    ---    **46.

I am leaking some yellowish fluid from my nipples. What should I do?**  This fluid is called **colostrum**, or \"first milk.\" You don't have to worry, as it is an immune- boosting fluid that your baby will drink in the first few days after birth.
